# DSC106_Final

For this project, I was curious to see if the Warriors' success could be credited to this idea of “Teamwork”.

As may be aware of, the warriors are a NBA team have had a huge amount of success recently. So what is it that made them so successful? Well, it could be the fact that they have a few all-star players of their own, but more importantly, it’s how these all-stars know how to work together.

In this dashboard we will demonstrate how the warriors ability to work as a team has made them one of the best in the world.

[This idea came partly from domain knowledge and also media observance of the Warriors being labeled as a team with good chemistry. Some things we chose to explore that seemed to quantify “teamwork” were passes between the players as well as assists, which are passes from a teammate directly resulting in a scored basket (not a player dribbling individually).]
